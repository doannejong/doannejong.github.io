Hi! I am a Ph.D. Candidate in Applied and Interdisciplinary Mathematics at University of Michigan, Ann Arbor and a Rackham Merit Fellow. I was a<a href="https://lsa.umich.edu/math/graduates/GraduateStudentHandbook/the-marjorie-lee-browne-scholars-program.html">Marjorie Browne Lee Scholar</a> from 2019-2021. 

My thesis project with Peter Miller studies solutions to the semiclassical, nonlinear defocusing Schr&ouml;dinger equation by solving a Riemann-Hilbert problem.
