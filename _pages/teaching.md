#### University of Michigan, Ann Arbor
As a graduate student instructor, I prepared lectures, quizzes, and other in-class assignments. I held weekly office hours, including one hour in the Math Lab, which is open to all undergraduate students who ares seeking help with introductory classes. I also assisted with the uniform grading of exams.

#### University of California, Santa Cruz
I was both Modified Supplemental Instructor and a small group tutor at Learning Support Services. Additionally, I provided individual tutoring for students with accomodations. This experience was extremely valuable to me and prepared me for facilitating collaborative group problem solving sessions as a graduate student instructor.
